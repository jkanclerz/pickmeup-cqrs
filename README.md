# PickMeUp! CQRS Implementation Application

This repository has been created to check, learn and code in CQRS convention.

Don't consider this as a "real" and correct CQRS implementation also at this stage. 
It's just my playground.


As you can see, i do my best to keep code clean and &raquo;well tested&laquo;. 

That's why i use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/), [Scrutinizer-CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/welltested/pickmeup-cqrs/) and [Humbug](https://github.com/padraic/humbug) (mutation testing tool to create tests even more rigorous).
